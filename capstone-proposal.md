Name of Student: Michael Carroll

Name of Project: The Circuit

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The Circuit is a social media app that focuses solely on events. The idea is friends can create events and share them with other friends, family, co-workers, etc. There will be no status updates or sharing of photos, this is just meant to be a living and breathing calendar that friends have access to. The end users control what is shared with different groups ie. friends, family, coworkers, etc.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Front end user interface.
- Login/ auth for storing events.
- Event plotting/ list (either on a calendar or in a sorted list by date)

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- React.js frontend on Firebase.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Big Calendar Component for React
- C# Backend with Supabase. This will allow for the usage of shared tables which will be needed inorder to track friend lists, friend requests, which groups can see which events.
- Address Validation for event locations. This will be used to make sure addresses of events are not entered incorrectly, this could also tie into mapping services such as a bing api or google api.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- I am really trying to keep my MVP realistic and attainable (which I think it is), there isn't a world in which I don't see going beyond my MVP.
